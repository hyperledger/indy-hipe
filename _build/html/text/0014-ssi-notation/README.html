<span id="hipe-0014-ssi-notation"></span><h1>HIPE 0014-ssi-notation<a class="headerlink" href="#hipe-0014-ssi-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This HIPE describes a simple, standard notation for various concepts related
to independent identity (II) and self-sovereign identity (SSI). (II and SSI
are related but not synonymous, in that IoT things are independent but not
sovereign owners; the HIPE covers both but uses SSI in its name as the more
recognized term.)</p>
<p>The notation could be used in design docs, other HIPEs, source code comments,
chat channels, scripts, debug logs, and miscellaneous technical
materials throughout the Indy ecosystem. We hope it is also used in the larger
SSI community.</p>
<p>This HIPE is complementary to the <a class="reference external" href="https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/">Sovrin Glossary</a>, which carefully curates terms and their
meanings. We start from the concepts and verbiage defined there. Another
complementary effort is the work to standardize ZKLang (a symbolic
language for representing zero knowledge proof.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<span id="motivation"></span><h1>Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All technical materials in our ecosystem hinge on fundamental concepts of
self-sovereign identity such as owners, keys, DIDs, and agents. We need a
standard, documented notation to refer to such things, so we can
use it consistently, and so we can link to the notation’s spec for
definitive usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tutorial">
<span id="tutorial"></span><h1>Tutorial<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The following explanation is meant to be read sequentially and should provide a
friendly overview for most who encounter the HIPE. See the
<a class="reference external" href="#reference">Reference section</a>
for quick lookup.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<span id="requirements"></span><h2>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This notation aims to be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Precise</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Terse</li>
<li>Easy to learn, understand, guess, and remember</li>
<li>Representable in 7-bit ASCII plain text</li>
</ul>
<p>The final requirement deserves special comment. Cryptologists are
a major stakeholder in SSI theory. They already have many
notational conventions, some more standardized than others.
Generally, their notation derives from advanced math and uses
specialized symbols and fonts. These experts also tend
to intersect strongly with academic circles, where LaTeX and similar
rendering technologies are common.</p>
<p>Despite the intersection between SSI, cryptology, and academia, SSI
has to serve a broader audience. Its practicioners are not just
mathematicians; they may include support and IT staff, lawyers
specializing in intellectual property, business people, auditors,
regulators, or even so-called “end users.” In particular, SSI
ecosystems are built and maintained by coders.
Coders regularly write docs in markdown and html. They interact with
one another on chat. They write emails and source code where comments
might need to be embedded. They create UML diagrams. They type in shells.
They paste code into slide decks and word processors. All of these
behaviors militate against a notation that requires complex markup.
Instead, we want something simple, clean, and universally supported.
Hence the 7-bit ASCII requirement. A future version of this HIPE,
or an addendum to it, might explain how to map this 7-bit
ASCII notation to various schemes that use mathematical symbols
and are familiar to experts from other fields.</p>

<div class="section" id="solution">
<span id="solution"></span><h2>Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#solution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="entities">
<span id="entities"></span><h3>Entities<a class="headerlink" href="#entities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Entities are the primary actors in the SSI ecosystem. They, at minimum
control but often own their self-sovereign domain. They are not, conceptually
at least, a digital actor. This notation separates the need for an Identity
from the software/hardware that implement the functionality that might
be described by this notation that provides digital identity. Entities
could be a thing that would seem to be a digital actor (ex. self-driving
car), but the notation will still specify both the Entity and other
elements of their domain the provide digital functionality.</p>
<p>Two types of entities are being defined. Things and Identity Owners.
Each have their own sections below and define their own syntax.</p>
<p><img alt="taxonomy" src="../../_images/taxonomy.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="identity-owners">
<span id="identity-owners"></span><h4>Identity Owners<a class="headerlink" href="#identity-owners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In a self-sovereign worldview, the conceptual center of gravity is
<strong>identity owners</strong>. These are people and institutions–the type of
entity that can (at least theoretically) be held legally accountable
for its actions. Identity owners control a <strong>sovereign domain</strong> that
encompasses all their agents, data, and devices. The notation’s first
goal is therefore an efficient and unambiguous way to anchor
derivative concepts to owners and their domains.</p>
<p>Identity owners are denoted with a single
capital ASCII alpha, often corresponding to their first initial. For
example, Alice might be represented as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>. By preference, the first
half of the alphabet is used (because “x”, “y”, and “z” tend to have
other ad-hoc meanings). When reading aloud, the spoken form of
a symbol like this is the name of the letter. The relevant <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234">ABNF</a> fragment is:</p>
<div class="highlight-ABNF notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="nc">ucase-alpha</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="l">%x41-5A</span>            <span class="c1">; A-Z</span>
 <span class="nc">lcase-alpha</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="l">%x61-7A</span>            <span class="c1">; a-z</span>
 <span class="nc">digit</span>          <span class="o">=</span> <span class="l">%x30-39</span>            <span class="c1">; 0-9</span>
 
 <span class="nc">identity-owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">ucase-alpha</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Because the domain of an identity owner is like their private
universe, the name or symbol of an identity owner is often used
to denote a domain as well; context eliminates ambiguity. You
will see examples of this below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things">
<span id="things"></span><h4>Things<a class="headerlink" href="#things" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Identity owners are not the only participants in an SSI ecosystem.
Other participants include Things that control their own domain.
These <strong>entities</strong> may have a high degree of autonomy (e.g., an AI in
a self-driving car), but they are owned, operated, or controlled in at
least some sense by another party.</p>
<p>Note that non-identity-owner entities also control a <strong>domain</strong>,
but it is not <em>self-sovereign</em>. Anywhere that the notation allows domains,
any type of domain is possible.</p>
<p>Things are denoted with a single lower case ASCII alpha. Can correspond to
the first letter of a larger name for the thing. For example, Car AI could be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c</span></code>. For clarity, it would be best practice to choose letter that don’t match
other Identity Owners used in the same description. Identity Owners and Things
differ in character case but using the same letter would often be confusing.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="association">
<span id="association"></span><h4>Association<a class="headerlink" href="#association" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Since Entities don’t directly act in the SSI Ecosystem; people,
organizations and even things can’t of themselves do digital operations
(ex. compute digital signatures). They require software and/or hardware
to do the digital work of their digital Identity. These software/hardware
elements are part of the Entity’s domain and serve the master of the domain.
Elements associated with a domain must be named in a way that
makes their association clear, using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name&#64;context</span></code> pattern familiar
from email addresses: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1&#64;A</span></code> (“one at A”) is agent 1 in A’s sovereign domain.
(Note how we use an erstwhile identity owner symbol, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>, to reference a
domain here, but there is no ambiguity.) This fully qualified form of an
entity reference is useful for clarification but is often not necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to domains, this same associating notation may be used where
a <em>relationship</em> is the context, because sometimes the association is
to the relationship rather than to a participant. See the DID
example in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="agents">
<span id="agents"></span><h4>Agents<a class="headerlink" href="#agents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Agents are not Entities. They neither control or own a domain. They
live and act with in a domain. They are always owned and controlled by
Entity and live within the their domain. Agents are the first example
of elements associated with an Entity. Despite this, agents are the
primary source of action with SSI ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, agents are distinct from devices, even though
we often (and inaccurately) used them interchangeably. We may
say things like “Alice’s iPhone sends a message” when we more
precisely mean “the agent on Alice’s iPhone sends a message.”
In reality, there may be zero, one, or more than one agents
running on a particular device.</p>
<p>Agents are numbered and are represented by up to three digits and
then with an association. In most discussions, one digit is
plenty, but three digits are allowed so agents can be
conveniently grouped by prefix (e.g., all edge agents in Alice’s
domain might begin with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code>, and all cloud might begin with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>).</p>

<p>Devices are another example of an element that are part of an Entity’s
domain. Devices are digital hardware that are part of an Entity’s domain.</p>
<p>Devices are both represented with two or more
lower-case ASCII alphanumerics or underscore characters, where the
first char cannot be a digit and ended with an association:

<span id="short-form-more-common"></span><h4>Short Form (more common)<a class="headerlink" href="#short-form-more-common" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Alice’s pairwise relationship with Bob is represented with colon
notation: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:B</span></code>. This is read aloud as “A to B” (preferred because
it’s short; alternatives such as “the A B relationship” or “A colon B”
or “A with respect to B” are also valid). When written in the other order,
it represents the same relationship as seen from Bob’s point of view.
Note that IoT things may also participate in relationships: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:bobs_car</span></code>.
(Contrast <a class="reference external" href="#intra-domain-relationships">Intra-Domain Relationships</a> below.)</p>
<p>N-way relationships (e.g., doctor, hospital, patient) are written with
the perspective-governing entity’s identifier, a single colon, then by all other
identifiers for members of the relationship, in alphabetical order,

<p>Short form is convenient and brief, but it is inconsistent because each
party to the relationship describes it differently. Sometimes this may
be undesirable, so a long and consistent form is also supported. The long
form of both pairwise and N-way relationships lists all participants to
the right of the colon, in alphabetical order. Thus the long forms of the
Alice to Bob relationship might be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:A+B</span></code> (for Alice’s view of this
relationship) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B:A+B</span></code> (for Bob’s view). For a doctor, hospital,
patient relationship, we might have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D:D+H+P</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">H:D+H+P</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">P:D+H+P</span></code>.
Note how the enumeration of parties to the right of the colon is consistent.</p>
<p>Long form and short form are allowed to vary freely; any tools that parses
this notation should treat them as synonyms and stylistic choices only.</p>
<p>The ABNF for long form is identical to short form, except that we are
guaranteed that after the colon, we will see at least two parties and
one <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> character:</p>

<span id="generalized-relationships"></span><h4>Generalized Relationships<a class="headerlink" href="#generalized-relationships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Some models for SSI emphasize the concept of <strong>personas</strong>. These are
essentially “masks” that an identity owner assumes, exposing a limited
subset of self to a generalized audience. For example, Alice might assume
one persona in her employment relationships, another for government
interactions, another for friends, and another when she’s a customer.
(The wisdom of personas versus pairwise relationships is a matter of
some debate.)</p>
<p>Personas can be modeled as a relationship with a generalized audience:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:Work</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:Friends</span></code>.</p>

</div>
<p>The concept of public DIDs suggests that someone may think about a
relationship as unbounded, or as not varying no matter who the other
entity is. For example, a company may create a public DID and advertise
it to the world, intending for this connection point to begin relationships
with customers, partners, and vendors alike. While best practice suggests
that such relationships be used with care, and that they primarily serve to
bootstrap pairwise relationships, the notation still needs to represent the
possibility.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="#reserved-tokens">token <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Any</span></code> is reserved</a> for these semantics. If Acme Corp

<p>Entities associated with a domain may be named in a way that

from email addresses: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1&#64;A</span></code> (“one at A”) is agent 1 in A’s sovereign domain.

domain here, but there is no ambiguity.) This fully qualified form of an
entity reference is useful for clarification but is often not necessary.</p>
<p>In addition to domains, this same associating notation may be used where
a <em>relationship</em> is the context, because sometimes the association is
to the relationship rather than to a participant. See the DID

<p>The mention of keys belonging to agents naturally raises the question of DID
Docs and the things they contain. How do they relate to our notaiton?
<a class="reference external" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#the-generic-did-scheme">DIDs are designed to be URIs</a>, and items that carry
an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code> property within a DID Doc <a class="reference external" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#fragments">can be referenced with standard URI fragment
notation</a>. This allows someone, for example,
to refer to the first public key used by one of the agents owned by Alice with
a notation like: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">did:sov:VUrvFeWW2cPv9hkNZ2ms2a;#key1</span></code>.</p>
<p>This notation is important and useful, but it is somewhat orthogonal to the concerns
of this HIPE. In the context of SSI notation, we are not DID-centric; we are
owner centric, and owners are identified by a single capital alpha instead of
by their DID. This helps with brevity. It lets us ignore the specific DID value
and instead focus on the higher level semantics; compare:</p>
<blockquote><code>{A.did@A:B}/B --> B</code></blockquote><p>…to:</p>
<blockquote><code>did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe</code> sends its DID for
<code>did:sov:6tb15mkMRagD7YA3SBZg3p</code> to 
<code>did:sov:6tb15mkMRagD7YA3SBZg3p</code>,
using the agent possessing <code>did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe;#key1</code>
to encrypt with the corresponding signing key.</blockquote><p>We expect DID reference notation (the verbose text above) to be relevant for
concrete communication between computers, and SSI notation (the terse equivalent
shown first) to be more convenient for symbolic, higher
level discussions between human beings. Occasionally, we may get very specific
and map SSI notation into DID notation (e.g., <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.1.vk</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">did:sov:PXqKt8sVsDu9T7BpeNqBfe;#key1</span></code>).</p>

<p>Sometimes, a concept or value evolves over time. For example, a given discussion
might need to describe a DID Doc or an endpoint or a key across multiple
state changes. In mathematical notation, this would typically be modeled with
subscripts. In our notation, we use square brackets, and we number beginning
from zero. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.pk[0]&#64;A:B</span></code> would be the first pubkey used by A in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A:B</span></code>
relationship; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.pk[1]&#64;A:B</span></code> would be the second pubkey, and so on. Likewise, a

<div class="section" id="negotiation-patterns">
<span id="negotiation-patterns"></span><h3>Negotiation Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#negotiation-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A common interaction pattern in SSI ecosystems is negotiation. It involves
sequences like this:</p>
<p><img alt="negotiation pattern" src="../../_images/negotiation-pattern.png" /></p>
<p>Credential issuance follows this pattern: credential offer (step 1a) is either
followed by an incompatible credential request (1b)–and this pair of messages
repeats as needed–or by a compatible credential request (2). A credential is
then issued (3). Possibly the holder of the credential acknowledges receipt (4).</p>
<p>Proving follows this pattern (though it nearly always begins with a request).
Connections follow this pattern. Price negotiations follow this pattern.</p>
<p>The notation <a class="reference external" href="#reserved-tokens">reserves standard kebab suffixes</a> on messages to
make this pattern obvious and consistent: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-offer</span></code> (step 1a), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-req</span></code> (step 1b
or 2), and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-receipt</span></code> (step 4). Step 3 is typically named without a suffix.
Thus: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proof-offer</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proof-request</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proof</span></code> (no suffix), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proof-receipt</span></code>.</p>

<div class="section" id="payments">
<span id="payments"></span><h3>Payments<a class="headerlink" href="#payments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Economic activity is part of rich SSI ecosystems, and requires notation. A
<strong>payment address</strong> is denoted with the <a class="reference external" href="#reserved-tokens"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pay</span></code> reserved token</a>;
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.pay[4]</span></code> would be A’s fifth payment address.
The public key and secret key for a payment address use the
<a class="reference external" href="#reserved-tokens"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ppk</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">psk</span></code> reserved token</a>, respectively. Thus, one way to reference
the payment keys for that payment address would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.pay[4].ppk</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.pay[4].psk</span></code>. (Keys are normally held by agents, not by people–and every
agent has its own keys. Thus, another notation for the public key
pertaining to this address might be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A.1.pay[4].ppk</span></code>. This is an area of
clumsiness that needs further study.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encryption">
<span id="encryption"></span><h3>Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Encryption deserves special consideration in the SSI world. It often figures
prominently in discussions about security and privacy, and our notation needs
to be able to represent it carefully.</p>
<p>The following crypto operations are recognized by the notation, without
making a strong claim about how the operations are implemented. (For
example, inline Diffie Helman and an ephemeral symmetric key might be
used for the *_crypt algorithms. What is interesting to the notation
isn’t the low-level details, but the general semantics achieved.)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anon_crypt(msg,</span> <span class="pre">recipient_pubkey)</span></code> – Encrypt
only for recipient, achieving confidentiality. Sender is anonymous.
Parties may have had no prior contact, though sender must discover
recipient’s pubkey. The message is tamper evident.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">auth_crypt(msg,</span> <span class="pre">recipient_pubkey,</span> <span class="pre">sender_privkey)</span></code> – Encrypt
only for recipient, achieving confidentiality. Recipient
learns sender’s pubkey but can’t prove to anybody else who the sender
is (making the message repudiable). Parties may have had no prior contact,
though sender must discover recipient’s pubkey.
The message is tamper evident.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sign(msg,</span> <span class="pre">signer_privkeys)</span></code> – Associate a signature with a
message, making the message <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol/blob/master/janus/repudiation.md">non-repudiable</a>.
This also makes the message tamper-evident. A signature does not
automatically encrypt and therefore is not a way to achieve
confidentiality. Note that complex signature schemes (multisig, M of N, ring)
use this operation as well.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">verify(msg,</span> <span class="pre">signature,</span> <span class="pre">signer_pubkeys)</span></code> – Verify a signature over a
message with select keys. Note that complex verification schemes
(multiverify, M of N, ring) use this operation as well.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sym_crypt(msg,</span> <span class="pre">sym_key)</span></code> – Symmetrically encrypt for anyone
who has the symmetric key, achieving a limited form of confidentiality.
Key must be shared in advance with both parties. Likely tamper
evident. If multiple parties know the symmetric key, the sender is
not knowable to the recipient.</li>
</ul>
<p>The notation for these crypto primitives uses curly braces around the
message, with suffixes to clarify semantics. Generally,
it identifies a recipient as an identity owner or thing, without clarifying
the key that’s used–the pairwise key for their DID is assumed.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The relative order of suffixes reflects whether encryption or
signing takes place first: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;}*B#</span></code> says that symmetric
encryption happens first, and then a signature is computed over
the cypertext; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;#}*B</span></code> says that plaintext is signed, and
then both the plaintext and the signature are encrypted. (The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;}#*B</span></code> variant is nonsensical because it splits the
encryption notation in half).</p>
<p>All suffixes can be further decorated with a parenthesized algorithm
name, if precision is required: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;}*(aes256)B</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;}/(rsa1024)A:B</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{&quot;hello&quot;#(ecdsa)}/B</span></code>.</p>
<p>With signing, usually the signer and sender are assumed to be identical,
and the notation omits any clarification about the signer. However,
this can be added after <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span></code> to be explicit. Thus, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg#B}~C</span></code> would be
a message with plaintext signed by B, anon-encrypted for C. Similarly,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg#(ring-rabin)BGJM}~A:C</span></code> would be a message with plaintext signed
according to a Rabin ring signature algorithm, by B, G, J, and M, and
then auth-encrypted by A for C.</p>
<p>Signing verification would be over the corresponding message and which
entities perform the action. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg#A}?B</span></code> would be a message with plaintext
signed by A verified by B. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg#(threshold-sig)ABC}?DE</span></code> would be a plaintext
message signed according to a threshold signature algorithm by A, B, C
and then verified by D and E.</p>
<p>Multiplexed asymmetric encryption is noted above, but has not yet been
described. This is a technique whereby a message body is encrypted with
an ephemeral symmetric key, and then the ephemeral key is encrypted
asymmetrically for multiple potential recipients (each of which has a unique
but tiny payload [the key] to decrypt, which in turn unlocks the main payload). The
notation for this looks like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg}%BCDE</span></code> for multiplexed anon_crypt (sender
is anonymous), and like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{msg}%A:BCDE</span></code> for multiplexed auth_crypt (sender
is authenticated by their private key).</p>

<div class="section" id="other-punctuation">
<span id="other-punctuation"></span><h3>Other punctuation<a class="headerlink" href="#other-punctuation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Message sending is represented with arrows: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-&gt;</span></code> is most common, though <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;-</span></code>
is also reasonable in some cases. Message content and notes about sending
can be embedded in the hyphens of sending arrow, as in this example, where
the notation says an unknown party uses http to transmit “hello”, anon-enrcypted

<p>Parentheses have traditional meaning (casual usage in written language, plus
grouping and precedence).</p>
<p>Angle braces <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> are for placeholders; any
reasonable explanatory text may appear inside the angle braces, so to

<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">LaTeX</a> provides powerful
and beautiful rendering of complex formal concepts, and uses escape sequences that are
pure ASCII. There is a <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jlatex/">JVM-based parser/renderer for Latex</a>; perhaps similar things exist for other
programming languages as well.</p>
<p>However, LaTeX has drawbacks. It focuses on rendering,
not on the semantics behind what’s rendered. In
this respect, it is a bit like HTML 1.0 before CSS–you can bold or underline,
but you’re usually encoding what something looks like, not what it means. (LaTeX
does support logical styles and sections, but this introduces far more complexity
than we need.)</p>
<p>The LaTeX snippet <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e^{-x_y}</span></code> should render like this:</p>
<p><img alt="e^{-x_y} rendered by LaTeX engine" src="../../_images/expression.png" /></p>
<p>This is great–but it doesn’t say anything about what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span></code> <em>mean</em>. Thus a LaTeX
solution would still have to define conventions for meaning in a separate spec.
These conventions would have to find representations that are not obvious
(LaTeX recommends no particular rendering for encryption functions, keys,
ownership, association). And such a spec would have to be careful not to
ascribe meaning to a rendering that conflicts with assumptions of
knowledgeable LaTeX users (e.g., using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\sqrt</span></code> for something other than
its mathematical square root function in the vocabulary would raise eyebrows).</p>
<p>Highly formatted LaTeX is also quite verbose.</p>
<p>A very simple form of LaTeX could be used (e.g., just superscripts and subscripts)–
but this would have to solve some of the problems <a class="reference external" href="#superscripts">mentioned below</a>, in the
DKMS section.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://asciimath.org/">ASCIIMath</a> has many of the same benefits and drawbacks as
LaTeX. It is less ubiquitous.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The key management notation introduced in “<a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/dkmsv3">DKMS (Decentralized Key Management
System) V3</a>” overlaps significantly with the concerns of this notation (render <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/677a0439487a1b7ce64c2e62671ed3e0079cc11f/doc/design/005-dkms/08-add-connection-private-did-provisioned.puml">this
diagram</a> for an example). However, it does not encompass all the concerns
explored here, so it would have to be expanded before it could be complete.</p>
<p>Also, experiments with superscripts and subscripts in this format led to semantic
dead ends or undesirable nesting when patterns were applied consistently. For
example, one thought had us representing Alice’s verkey, signing key, and DID for her
Bob relationship with A<sub>B</sub><sup>VK</sup>, A<sub>B</sub><sup>SK</sup>.
and A<sub>B</sub><sup>DID</sup>. This was fine until we asked how to represent
the verkey for Alice’s agent in the Alice to Bob relationship; is that
A<sub>B</sub><sup>DID<sup>VK</sup></sup>? And what about Alice’s link secret, that
isn’t relationship-specific? And how would we handle N-way relationships?</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Do we need to support non-ASCII characters in the notation? (I suggest no–for coders
wishing to share simple algebra-like notes in comments or on chat, ASCII is a reasonable
least-common denominator usable with any keyboard or natural language. Adding more complicates
too many things.)</li>
<li>Do we need special notation for credentials, proofs, and the like? If so, how does
this relate to ZKLang?</li>
