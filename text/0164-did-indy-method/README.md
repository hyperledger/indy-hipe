- Author: Daniel Bluhm <daniel@indicio.tech>, Char Howland <char@indicio.tech>, Adam Burdett <adam@indicio.tech>
- Start Date: 2022-03-25

## Status
- Status: [PROPOSED](/README.md#hipe-lifecycle)
- Status Date: 2022-04-01
- Status Note: Implementation complete in Indy Node (in Indicio-tech:feature/did-indy-new, to be merged into Hyperledger:ubuntu-20.04-upgrade), and in Indy VDR.

## Summary

This proposal details changes to Indy Node required to implement support for the [DID Indy Method Version 1.0](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/). These changes add support for W3C DID Specification compliant identifiers and documents on Indy Ledgers.


## Motivation

The Indy DID Method aligns Indy with the DID Core specification by formalizing the transformation of an Indy ledger object into a W3C DID Core Spec-compliant DID Document. Previous to the definition of the Indy DID Method specification, DID Documents from Indy NYMs were constructed following convention only. This convention used NYM and ATTRIB transactions to construct rudimentary DID Documents.

In addition, the Indy DID Method implements a network-specific identifier, creating a "network of networks" capability where an Indy DID can be uniquely resolved to a specific DID Document stored on a specific Indy network using a common resolver software component. This enables useful properties including decentralization, scalability, fit for purpose, and governance. There are no related code changes in Indy Node, which is ignorant of its own name.

The changes in this proposal mark the beginning of efforts to allow a holder/prover to receive credentials from issuers from different Indy networks and be able to construct a single AnonCreds verifiable presentation that uses all of those credentials. The proposed changes also allow an issuer to publish a DID Doc on an Indy ledger containing a BLS Key so that they can issue W3C Standard Verifiable JSON-LD Credentials using BBS+ Signatures.

Backwards compatibility within Indy Networks and with Indy Network clients is a requirement for the changes proposed.

## Tutorial

### Changes to NYM Transaction

#### Summary

- Add optional `diddocContent` to operation. See [DIDDoc Support](#diddoc-support)
- Add optional `version` to operation. See [Self-Certification of DIDs](#self-certification-of-dids).


#### DIDDoc Support

As discussed in [Indy DID Method 10.1: Creation](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/#creation), to support writing full W3C compliant DID Documents to Indy Ledgers, this proposal adds an optional new attribute, `diddocContent`, to NYM transactions. This attribute will be a `JsonField` (JSON encoded string) with a 10KiB length limit imposed. The contents of this field will be validated according to the rules in [Validating DID Doc Content](#validating-did-doc-content).


#### Self-Certification of DIDs

Previously, NYM transactions did not require any link between their identifier and verification key. This makes proving ownership of Indy DIDs more difficult as arbitrary values (including "vanity DIDs") could be used, as long as they were in the Base58 alphabet. The Indy DID Method Specification corrects for this by introducing an explicit mechanism for self-certification. However, this mechanism causes problems with backwards compatibility.

This proposal implements optional self-certification by including a new field that indicates to the handler whether the submitted NYM is self-certifying. The self-certification algorithm to be validated on NYM creation is specified by the `version` field with the following expected values and meanings:

- `0` - no validation of namespace identifier and initial verkey binding is performed.
- `1` - validate according to the convention used in the Indy SDK, in which the DID must be the first 16 bytes of the Verification Method public key.
- `2` - validate according to the `did:indy` method specification, in which the namespace identifier component of the DID (last element) is derived from the initial public key of the DID, using the base58 encoding of the first 16 bytes of the SHA256 of the Verification Method public key.

The NYM transaction version field is optional and defaults to 0, or no validation of namespace identifier and initial verkey binding, if not set. If set, it is stored in the state of the NYM and returned on `GET_NYM`. Writers of NYM transactions are incentivized to use NYM transaction version 2 for the stronger guarantees on DID ownership. NYM transactions not using self-certification have the same security profile as all NYM transactions prior to the implementation of this proposal.


### Changes to GET_NYM Transaction

#### Summary

- Add optional `seqNo` to operation.
- Add optional `timestamp` to operation.

See [Resolving by versionID and versionTime](#resolving-by-versionid-and-versiontime).


### Changes to ATTRIB Transaction

#### ATTRIB Deprecation

It is proposed that usage of ATTRIB transactions receive a "soft" deprecation with the introduction of support for the `did:indy` method.

The only common use of ATTRIBs in Hyperledger Indy prior to `did:indy` was to define DIDDoc service endpoints for a DID. Since with `did:indy` such a service endpoint can be added directly to the DID (along with any other DIDDoc data) there is no need to continue the use of the older ATTRIB endpoint convention. While a Hyperledger Indy client (such as Indy) MAY continue to try to resolve an endpoint ATTRIB when there is no DIDDoc content in a resolved DID, the ongoing practice of using an ATTRIB for that or any other purpose is discouraged.


### Changes to GET_ATTRIB Transaction

#### Summary

- Add optional `seqNo` to operation.
- Add optional `timestamp` to operation.

See [Resolving by versionID and versionTime](#resolving-by-versionid-and-versiontime).


#### Optional Continued use of GET_ATTRIB

As outlined in the [Indy DID Method 10.1.6](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/#the-endpoint-attrib), network clients may continue to retrieve endpoint info from a previously written ATTRIB transaction associated with a NYM. Additionally, as described in [Indy DID Method 10.3.1](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/#did-versions), it is now possible to retrieve previous versions of DID Documents (or DID Documents composed of NYM + ATTRIB transactions). To support this, this proposal adds additional fields to the `GET_ATTRIB` transaction, `seqNo` and `timestamp`. See [Resolving by versionID and versionTime](#resolving-by-versionid-and-versiontime) for more details.


## Reference

### Validating DID Doc Content

Validation of the DID Document Content should be as minimal as possible. Minimal validation of the document content should ensure basic construction of a full DID Document while enabling usage of DID Document features not yet standardized or conceived. Overly strict validation would require code and network updates to allow such new features to be used on Indy Networks.

DID Doc Content should be validated as follows:
- Content is a JSON string (enforced by transaction operation schema)
- Content must not include id at root of the object
- Content must not include any nested objects with an id ending in <nym>#verkey


### Resolving by versionId and versionTime

As described in [Indy DID Method 10.3.1 DID Versions](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/#did-versions), the Indy DID Method allows for the resolution of a particular version of a DID based on `versionId` (corresponding to a transaction sequence number) or on `versionTime` (corresponding to a transaction timestamp).

Indy natively supports retrieving transactions by sequence number using `GET_TXN`. Indy also supports retrieving the state of a NYM at a particular point in time; however, this is not exposed directly in any read transactions but `GET_TAA` where it is used to check the value of the TAA at a given point in time.

To support resolving by `versionId` and `versionTime`, two new attributes are added to the `GET_NYM` and `GET_ATTRIB` transactions:
- `seqNo` (equivalent to `versionId`) - sequence number of the transaction resulting in the state we wish to retrieve
- `timestamp` (equivalent to `versionTime`) - retrieve state at this timestamp (state exactly at the time or before). This value is a POSIX timestamp.

`seqNo` and `timestamp` are mutually exclusive; if both are present, the client is informed of an invalid request. It will be the responsibility of the Resolver to transform a DID URL with these query parameters into the expected transaction format.


## Drawbacks

### Additional field for self-certification

As discussed [above](#self-certification-of-dids), enforcing self-certification for the `did:indy` method would limit backward compatibility. This method implements optional self-certification where the creator of a new NYM can set the self-certification algorithm that will be validated by setting the version. Although self-certification will be enforced in the future, rendering this field irrelevant, it will still have to be present for the forseeable future.


#### Additional cost incurred from resolving by `versionId`

A sequence number refers to a specific transaction on Indy Networks. This means that, by retrieving a transaction, we are retrieving the operation data or the specific action that took place in that transaction. In other words (in the context of NYMs, at least), a sequence number refers to a change to a NYM and not the state of the NYM after the change represented by the sequence number is applied. When retrieving by `versionId`, we are interested in the state of the NYM and not the change taking place at that version.

The following option was determined to be the best balance between backwards compatibility, minimizing required changes, and implementing the spec as currently defined. To resolve a DID Document by `versionId`, the `GetNymHandler` will:
1. Retrieve the transaction identified by the versionId (sequence number)
2. Extract timestamp from the transaction
3. Retrieve the root hash at (or nearest previous root hash to) that timestamp from the timestamp store
4. Retrieve value of NYM as contained in state at root hash

The drawback is that we have to resolve another transaction, which incurs additional cost, before recalling the state when the transaction identified by the sequence number was made.


## Rationale and alternatives

### Self-certifying NYMs

Originally, it was planned to impose the version 2 self-certification requirement across all NYM transactions. However, this would be a significant breaking change for users of Indy Networks. Indy SDK users (which form a majority of the user base) would be unable to write new NYMs without implementing workarounds as the SDK produces DIDs according to conventions incompatible with the self-certification requirement. As such, the strict enforcement self-certification was walked back and the opt-in method described above was proposed.

In the process of drawing these conclusions, we conducted investigations into a
few alternatives. The results of these investigations are included here.


#### Static Configuration

Using a static configuration parameter to trigger self-certification was considered. However, coordinating update of this configuration parameter across a network is considered impractical.


#### Dynamic Configuration via Config Ledger

NYM self-certification configuration could also be implemented using the config ledger. To achieve this, we could add two handlers for the config ledger:

- A transaction for updating the config and
- a transaction for reading the state of the configuration.

With a new variable stored in the config ledger, the NYM transaction handler will be able to query the config ledger in determining if self-certification should be enforced.

If there is a bottleneck in accessing the config from the Patricia trie, we propose adding a flat “config cache” storage for a quick retrieval during NYM transaction validation.


#### Conclusion

In the end, the opt-in self-certification provides much cleaner backwards compatibility without introducing new transactions or components.


### Storage of DID Doc Content

`diddocContent` will be stored directly in the domain ledger state and will not require an additional store (as is the case for ATTRIB transaction data).

While investigating options for storage, it was determined that ATTRIB data was stored separately due to being arbitrary data not strictly required to represent the identity identified by the associated Nym. The size of the ATTRIB data, while significant when compared to the size of the typical NYM transaction, is dwarfed by the potential size of CLAIM_DEF and SCHEMA transactions. ATTRIBs are capped at 5KiB of raw data (size limit is imposed by transaction operation schema). CLAIM_DEF and SCHEMA transactions have no size limits and are bounded only by the maximum permitted message size of the secure transport layer of 128KiB. Therefore, it was determined that reasonable size limits should be imposed on DID Documents but any size up to the 128KiB message size cap is unlikely to negatively impact the performance of the network.

On inspection of old issues relating to the size limit on ATTRIB data, the 5KiB limit was chosen to enable batching of more ATTRIB transactions into a single 128KiB max message. This use case appears to only arise in testing scenarios.

The proposed (but still somewhat arbitrary) `diddocContent` size cap is 10KiB. In future iterations, this (and other size limits) should be network configurable through the config ledger.


### Resolving a DIDDoc in a single transaction

Previous approaches to resolving Indy ledger objects into DIDDocs required the client read one or more ledger objects (notably, NYMs and ATTRIBs) before assembly. This is at best "challenging" for the client, and at worst, extremely slow without specialized ledger support, particularly when a non-current version of the DID is being resolved. A preferred approach is to enable the resolution of a DID via a single read transaction that returns a single object off the ledger, including a state proof for that object.

## Unresolved questions

### Linked Transactions
Linked transactions as a means to prove self-certification is under investigation. This would entail providing the last transaction that modified the retrieved NYM.
